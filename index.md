Social perception plays a central role in how language is interpreted: readers form impressions about intent, politeness, credibility, identity, and more from subtle linguistic cues. However, most NLP systems model such phenomena using surface-level proxies, often failing to capture how humans actually perceive language across contexts.

**NLPercep’26** aims to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from NLP, computational social science, sociolinguistics, psychology, and related fields to study how language is *perceived*—and not just what it encodes. The workshop places particular emphasis on the role of social perception in the era of large language models (LLMs) and evolving communication norms.
