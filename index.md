Social perception plays a central role in how language is interpreted: readers form impressions about intent, politeness, credibility, identity, and more from subtle linguistic cues. However, most NLP systems model such phenomena using surface-level proxies, often failing to capture how humans actually perceive language across contexts.

**NLPercep’26** aims to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from NLP, computational social science, sociolinguistics, psychology, and related fields to study how language is *perceived*—and not just what it encodes. The workshop places particular emphasis on the role of social perception in the era of large language models (LLMs) and evolving communication norms.

We invite interdisciplinary contributions that advance theoretical grounding, computational modeling, and empirical understanding of social perception in language. We welcome submissions on topics including (but not restricted to) the following:

- Self-perception, identity, and self-expression in language  
- Social group perception, stereotypes, and bias  
- Sociolinguistic perception and language attitude  
- Social norms, moral values, and evaluative judgments  
- Computational and NLP approaches to social perception  
- Large language models (LLMs) and social perception

## Submission Types

We invite the following types of submissions:

- **Long papers (5 to 8 pages)** that present original research, from preliminary findings to established contributions, including theory, experiments, or applications.  
- **Short papers (up to 4 pages)** that introduce emerging ideas, work in progress, or early-stage research with clear significance.  
- **Extended abstracts (up to 2 pages)** that present ongoing work, position papers, previously published work, or research projects. Abstracts can be submitted either for inclusion in the proceedings (archival) or as non-archival contributions.
